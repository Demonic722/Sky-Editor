Because most game related functionality is plugin based, to run Sky Editor, Build or Rebuild the solution first (BUILD -> Rebuild Solution), then run Sky Editor Base.
The startup project should always be Sky Editor Base, unless you are running one of the Debug Console Applications.
The plugins should already be configured to output into Sky Editor Base's plugin directory, at least for the existing solution configurations.
