In order to run this for the first time, you must build the following projects, prior to running Sky Editor Base:
-Sky Editor
-Sky Editor (Resources)

The reason for this is that they compile into the debug folder of Sky Editor Base and are dynamically loaded.

You may also need to download "Extended WPF Toolkit - 2.1.0" and place xceed.wpf.toolkit.dll into Sky Editor Plugin, as the dll is consistently not added to the source control.
